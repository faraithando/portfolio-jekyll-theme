My name is Farai Mhlabi, residing in Rugby. I hold an International Diploma in Investment and Portfolio Management and numerous certifications, including PRINCE2, Agile. With 9 years of experience as an Accounts Receivable Associate, I excel in managing client accounts, processing invoices, and ensuring prompt payment collection. My passion in dealing with projects has driven me to successfully complete both waterfall and agile projects. I thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments, bringing strong analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills. Outside of work, I enjoy learning about new methodologies and improving my skills.
